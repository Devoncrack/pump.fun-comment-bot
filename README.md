This is a Pump.Fun comment bot. 

It fakes logins to pump.fun and lets you comment with however many new SOL wallets you want.

If you want to modify the comments just modify the comments.json file.

To run it, just make sure you run `npm install` first and then run `node main.js`. (But modify the values at the bottom of that file.)

Do what you want with this transaction signing method!
